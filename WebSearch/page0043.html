<noscript> Leader’s Notesthe teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.Session Two The Pharisee and the Tax CollectorGrowing3. The people who were con dent of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else were the Pharisees and other religious leaders who saw themselves as the only ones righteous enough to be acceptable to God. Refer to the Study Notes in this session for more insight into the Pharisees. Such self-righteousness is damning (Rom. 10:3, Phil. 3:9) because we all fall short of God’s standard (Matt. 5:48) and are in need of salvation. See Luke 15:16 and Romans 14:10 for additional insight into this verse.4. The Pharisees were the most pious laypeople of the day, while the tax col- lectors were sharks. Yet both could approach God freely. We don’t have to clean up before we approach God; we need to approach him for his forgive- ness and help in cleaning up our act.5. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: The Pharisee’s prayer is entirely about himself. See Matthew 6:5 and Luke 22:41 for additional insight into this verse.“God, I thank you that I . . .” The key word here is that. Thank you that I . . . reinforces Jesus’s assertion in verse 9 that the Pharisees believed their righteousness was complete.“I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.” The Pharisee told God what a good man he was. He thanked God that he was not a sinner like everyone else. In this he erred in thinking that he was “not a sinner.” He lacked humility before God. Thanking God for who he was reveals that the Pharisee gave God the credit for who he was, but he considered himself better than other people, using other people as his standard for measuring righteousness. God, however, uses himself as the standard for righteousness, and he views arrogance and lack of compassion as sins on the level of adultery and theft. See Romans 3:23.91 </noscript>
