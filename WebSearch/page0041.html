<noscript> Leader’s Notesallowed to be called a slave. This is a sign of true repentance—he turned from his evil ways with no expectation for what would happen to him.10. The father had been watching and waiting for his son to return (v. 20). When he saw him, he ran to greet him. He was eager and joyous at the return of his son. His eagerness to forgive was so great that the son didn’t even get to  nish his apology (v. 21). Our Father in heaven watches and waits for the return of his children as well.11. The father gave his son honor (the best robe), authority (a ring), acceptance (sandals for his feet: sandals were not usually worn by slaves), and a celebra- tion of the event of his return ( ne feast symbolizing salvation’s blessings). See Genesis 41:42 and Zechariah 3:4 for additional insight on verse 22. The father poured out his love and expressed his joy that his once lost son had now been found—symbolizing the divine mercy of God. Just as the angels in heaven celebrate when a person repents and turns to the Lord, the father celebrated the return of his son. See Ephesians 2:5 and Colossians 2:13 for additional insight on verse 24.12. It is not easy for the older brother to embrace the return of his brother. He does not have the love of the father. This parallels the feeling of the Phari- sees toward Jesus and his disciples. The elder son symbolizes the Pharisees and other religious leaders, who had access to God’s truth but no sense of sin, no real love for the Father, and no interest in repentant sinners. They didn’t share God’s joy.13. Speaking to a parent in this way (v. 29) was contemptuous. It seems unlikely that he was the obedient son he claimed to be. And he did not recognize his own sin. Even his actions of the moment were a transgression of his father’s wishes. The older son’s reaction parallels the Pharisees’ complaining about Jesus in verse 2: But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” He held only contempt for his brother and was begrudging even the love that the father showed to the prodigal son. The son’s words also reveal that he thought his relation- ship with his father was based on his work. He was obedient (to a point) because of the expected reward, not out of love for his father.14. The inheritance has already been distributed (v. 12). The older son already has everything the father has to give him—money and possessions—and he also has his love. People like the older brother have trouble believing that God’s vast love and riches are already theirs. In a way, the older brother is the true runaway in this story, for he has never truly come home to trust his father.15. God will always be waiting for his children to return to him, and there will alwaysbethosewhorefusetojointheparty.JesusistellingthePhariseesand all who refuse to go to the celebration feast that this is a refusal to enter the kingdom that Jesus o ers to everyone. As leader, you should make it okay89 </noscript>
