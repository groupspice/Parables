<noscript> Leader’s NotesAppendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any im- portant upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The son’s actions give a picture of all sinners. After refusing any relationship with his father by defying his word and customs, the son chooses a life of sinful self-indulgence—prodigal living (v. 12). Requesting his inheritance while his father was still alive was like wishing his father was dead. Possibly, a nagging need for independence or need to be free of responsibility drove him. We can assume that the son planned his departure—it was not a spur-of-the-moment thing—as he took everything and left within a few days (v. 13).5. God has given us free will to make our own choices. For this reason, the father agreed to his son’s request, even though it likely hurt him greatly.6. Encourage the group to talk about how relationship problems, stress of busyness, work, responsibilities, etc., often precipitate a desire to  ee. When we try to run our lives on our own power, we become stressed and disori- ented, causing the desire to  ee. When we think only of ourselves and act accordingly, we are acting sel shly.7. The son’s sin separated him from his father; likewise, sin separates us from God.8. Theson’swastefulextravaganceandafamineinthelandlefthimdestitute— feeding swine in some pagan village to survive (v. 15). But it was not enough to sustain him and no one helped him. He would have eaten the pigs’ food if he could (v. 16). Jews would never allow themselves to come into contact with pigs, so Deuteronomy 14:8 shows us how far from righteousness the son had fallen. Nothing could be more degrading to a Jew.9. The prodigal  nally came to his senses and decided to go home and accept whatever was there for him (vv. 17–19); he planned to repent of his sel sh- ness and tell his father he was sorry. The son would have known that his father no longer had anything to give him because when the inheritance was given, it was to both sons. The father would be living on earnings from the inheritance, but the inheritance now belonged to the sons. He expected nothing (for he had left no personal possessions behind) and hoped to be88 </noscript>
