        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities. You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your5]]></text>

A Deepening Life Together: Parables Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Mark Strauss. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide, you will  nd space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’sscary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy 6]]></text>

It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.7]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstYou can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.8]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on the Parables. As we live this Bible study experience together during the next four weeks, we will unpack a few of the parablesor stories—Jesus told that reveal the faithfulness of God. The journey will bring us to a greater understanding of God’s love for his lost children and his desire that all return to him. As you read, discuss, and re ect on the topic of each session, your con dence in God’s faithfulness will grow to new heights.Jesus was a master storyteller. His parables—simple stories from everyday life—were entertaining yet contained a powerful spiritual message. The parables would lure people to listen and then catch them with powerful conviction in some area of spiritual need. Our  rst parents—Adam and Eve—compromised our relationship with God by a foolish ambition to be independent. Through these para- bles, Jesus reveals the nature of repentance and the Lord’s readiness to welcome and bless all who return to him.For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of commitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEPARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SONMemory Verse: “For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” So they began to celebrate (Luke 15:24 NIV).Jesus associated with sinners because he wanted to bring the lost— people considered beyond hope—the gospel of God’s kingdom. He sets forth the gospel of grace, encouraging everyone to repent and return to him.In telling the parable of the prodigal son, Jesus spoke to tax col- lectors and sinners in the hearing of the Pharisees (Luke 15:1–2). The message was for all of them.If you feel far from God, don’t despair. He is searching for you.ConnectingOpen your group with prayer. Ask God to prepare your hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to respond as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take the time to keep in frequent touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets11]]></text>

Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this Deepening Life Together: Parables small group study and what you expect to learn during the next four weeks.2. Talk about a time when you lost a child in a public place or you were separated from your family or friends in an unfamiliar place. How did you feel?3. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values we’ve found most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. We recommend that you review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have room to grow in—to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.GrowingThree lost-and-found stories are found in Luke, beginning in verse 15:4. In all the stories the message is the same: the loss causes extraor- dinary pain and a longing for that which is lost, and the  nding leads to extraordinary joy. The main theme of the three parables is God’s great joy in the salvation of the lost. The third one—the parable of the lost son—is perhaps the most famous parable Jesus told.Jesus spoke to to the least respectable Jews in his society in the hearing of some of the most devout, the Pharisees (Luke 15:1–2). Read Luke 15:11–32 aloud.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Parable of the Prodigal Son4. In Jewish society it was rare for a man to distribute his inheri- tance while he was still alive. Even more shocking is that the younger son asked that this be done (v. 12), because respect for parents was a strong social value. What do you think might have prompted the son to ask for his inheritance? What clue do you get from verse 13 about the son’s motives?Who in your life, or in our world, does the younger son remind you of? Why?5. How do you think the father might have felt about his son’s decisions?Why do you think the father agreed to the son’s request?6. Have you ever felt the need to escape, or have you ever known anyone to do this? What kinds of things precipitated it? What were the results?How do you think God views such actions?7. Our decisions frequently a ect our relationships with those closest to us. What e ect do you think the son’s rejection of his father (v. 14) had on their relationship?How do you think this relates to our relationship with our heavenly Father?8. Pig meat was unclean for Jews to eat (Deut. 14:8), and pagans had even persecuted Jews by forcing them to eat pork, so for Jews, pigs represented paganism. What does Luke 15:15 say about the condition of the younger son at this point in the story?9. The son  nally came to his senses and decided to return home. What does verse 17 say about the son’s initial reasons for re- turning home? What does verse 19 say about his expectations once he arrived there?13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Parables10. How does verse 20 communicate what the father had been going through while his son was gone?What do the father’s actions say about his feelings for his son?11. Talk about the signi cance of the robe, ring, sandals, and  ne feast the father bestowed on the son in verses 22–24. What do you think the father was saying with these gifts? See the Study Notes for help.12. When the older brother came home from working in the  eld and found his household celebrating the return of his prodi- gal brother, he was angry (v. 28). Why do you think that the older brother could not accept his brother’s return as his father did?13. What do you learn about the older brother’s character from verses 28–30? For instance, how would you assess his level of obedience to his father?14. “My son,” the father said, “you are always with me, and ev- erything I have is yours” (Luke 15:31 NIV).What is Jesus saying here to the “older brothers” among us?15. Verse 32 is an invitation to the Father’s joy. With which char- acter in the story—the younger brother, the older brother, or the father—do you most identify? Why?God’s love is never-ending, patient, and welcoming. He will reach out to us and give us opportunities to respond, but he will not force us to come to him. Like the father in this parable, God waits patiently for us to come to our senses.DevelopingGod has given every believer special gifts to be used for serving him and the body of Christ as the Holy Spirit leads.

One important way to discover and develop our God-given design is to partner with another Christian for spiritual connec- tion and accountability. We call this a spiritual partnership.We strongly recommend each of you partner with someone in the group to help you in your spiritual journey during this study. This person will be your spiritual partner for the next several weeks. He or she doesn’t have to be your best friend, but will simply encourage you to complete the goals you set for yourself during this study. Following through on a resolu- tion is tough when you’re on your own, but we’ve found it makes all the di erence to have a partner cheering us on. In the Appendix we’ve provided a Personal Health Plan, a chart for keeping track of your spiritual progress. You and your spiritual partner can use it for accountability to the goals you set for yourselves. See the Leader’s Notes for instructions for establishing spiritual partners and for beginning to use the Personal Health Plan.SharingJesus encouraged us to share his love and concern for the lost. As in the story of the prodigal son, the Father deals with human beings with a will of their own, but he is ready to greet his children if they choose to return to him. How can we help? We can take one of the small steps suggested below in the Circles of Life exercise.17. Use the Circles of Life diagram (next page) to help you think of people you come in contact with on a regular basis who need to be connected in Christian community. Try to write two names in each circle. Consider the following ideas for reaching out to one or two of the people you list and make a plan to follow through with them this week.t This is a wonderful time to welcome a few friends into your group.

Does your friend need a ride to the group or help with child care?t Consider inviting a friend to attend a weekend church ser- vice with you and possibly plan to enjoy a meal together afterward. This can be a great opportunity to talk with someone about your faith in Jesus.t Is there someone who is unable to attend your group but who still needs a connection? Would you be willing to have lunch or co ee with that person, catch up on life, and share something you’ve learned from this study? Jesus doesn’t call all of us to lead small groups, but he does call every disciple to spiritually multiply his or her life over time.Family(immediate or extended)Acquaintances(neighbors, kids’ sports teams, school, and so forth)Fun(gym, hobbies, hangouts)FriendsCo-workers(workplace)16]]></text>

Each group session will provide group members an opportunity to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. At the end of each session, we have provided Re ections for you to begin daily time with him. There are  ve daily Scrip- ture readings with room to record your thoughts. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning and help you develop the habit of time alone with God throughout the week.19. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.20. The Deepening Life Together: Parables Video Teaching DVD companion for this study includes worship sets for use during your study. Choose one of these to end your study today.Study NotesProdigal: A prodigal is one who is rashly or wastefully extravagant.Inheritance, the Right of the Firstborn: The Mosaic law regulated the succession to real property as follows: it has to be divided among the sons, the eldest receiving a double portion, the others equal shares; if there were no sons, it went to the daughters, on the condition that they did not marry out of their own tribe. If there were no daughters, it went to the brother of the deceased; if no brother, to the paternal uncle; and, failing these, to the next of kin.17]]></text>

The robe signi es distinction; the ring, authority; the sandals, a member of the family for slaves went barefoot; the feast, to celebrate a special occasion.For Deeper Study (Optional)Read each passage below and consider what the passage says about the questions that follow:We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and a icted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut o  from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to su er, and though the Lord makes his life a guilt o ering, he will see his o spring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After the su ering of his soul, he will see the light [of life] and be satis ed; by his knowl- edge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors (Isa. 53:6–12 NIV).18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Parable of the Prodigal Son• Isaiah speaks of Israel straying from God and compares them to wandering sheep. What does this say about the human condition?• Who is “he” who is spoken of in verses 7 and following? What is “his” role in our salvation?• What does verse 12b, “For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors,” indicate about how this salvation comes about?Therefore Jesus said again, “I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep. All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and  nd pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:7–11 NIV).• Have you given your life to Jesus Christ, the “good shepherd,” or are you still a wandering sheep?ReflectionsEach day, read the daily verses and give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day record a summary of what you have learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too47]]></text>

The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.48]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.49]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One The Parable of the Prodigal SonConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to take time to connect at this  rst session.2. Each session will include an icebreaker question that should help to set the tone for the Growing section of your group time. It’s important in this  rst session to allow time for everyone to participate in this icebreaker.3. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See the87LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any im- portant upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The son’s actions give a picture of all sinners. After refusing any relationship with his father by defying his word and customs, the son chooses a life of sinful self-indulgence—prodigal living (v. 12). Requesting his inheritance while his father was still alive was like wishing his father was dead. Possibly, a nagging need for independence or need to be free of responsibility drove him. We can assume that the son planned his departure—it was not a spur-of-the-moment thing—as he took everything and left within a few days (v. 13).5. God has given us free will to make our own choices. For this reason, the father agreed to his son’s request, even though it likely hurt him greatly.6. Encourage the group to talk about how relationship problems, stress of busyness, work, responsibilities, etc., often precipitate a desire to  ee. When we try to run our lives on our own power, we become stressed and disori- ented, causing the desire to  ee. When we think only of ourselves and act accordingly, we are acting sel shly.7. The son’s sin separated him from his father; likewise, sin separates us from God.8. Theson’swastefulextravaganceandafamineinthelandlefthimdestitute— feeding swine in some pagan village to survive (v. 15). But it was not enough to sustain him and no one helped him. He would have eaten the pigs’ food if he could (v. 16). Jews would never allow themselves to come into contact with pigs, so Deuteronomy 14:8 shows us how far from righteousness the son had fallen. Nothing could be more degrading to a Jew.9. The prodigal  nally came to his senses and decided to go home and accept whatever was there for him (vv. 17–19); he planned to repent of his sel sh- ness and tell his father he was sorry. The son would have known that his father no longer had anything to give him because when the inheritance was given, it was to both sons. The father would be living on earnings from the inheritance, but the inheritance now belonged to the sons. He expected nothing (for he had left no personal possessions behind) and hoped to be88]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesallowed to be called a slave. This is a sign of true repentance—he turned from his evil ways with no expectation for what would happen to him.10. The father had been watching and waiting for his son to return (v. 20). When he saw him, he ran to greet him. He was eager and joyous at the return of his son. His eagerness to forgive was so great that the son didn’t even get to  nish his apology (v. 21). Our Father in heaven watches and waits for the return of his children as well.11. The father gave his son honor (the best robe), authority (a ring), acceptance (sandals for his feet: sandals were not usually worn by slaves), and a celebra- tion of the event of his return ( ne feast symbolizing salvation’s blessings). See Genesis 41:42 and Zechariah 3:4 for additional insight on verse 22. The father poured out his love and expressed his joy that his once lost son had now been found—symbolizing the divine mercy of God. Just as the angels in heaven celebrate when a person repents and turns to the Lord, the father celebrated the return of his son. See Ephesians 2:5 and Colossians 2:13 for additional insight on verse 24.12. It is not easy for the older brother to embrace the return of his brother. He does not have the love of the father. This parallels the feeling of the Phari- sees toward Jesus and his disciples. The elder son symbolizes the Pharisees and other religious leaders, who had access to God’s truth but no sense of sin, no real love for the Father, and no interest in repentant sinners. They didn’t share God’s joy.13. Speaking to a parent in this way (v. 29) was contemptuous. It seems unlikely that he was the obedient son he claimed to be. And he did not recognize his own sin. Even his actions of the moment were a transgression of his father’s wishes. The older son’s reaction parallels the Pharisees’ complaining about Jesus in verse 2: But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” He held only contempt for his brother and was begrudging even the love that the father showed to the prodigal son. The son’s words also reveal that he thought his relation- ship with his father was based on his work. He was obedient (to a point) because of the expected reward, not out of love for his father.14. The inheritance has already been distributed (v. 12). The older son already has everything the father has to give him—money and possessions—and he also has his love. People like the older brother have trouble believing that God’s vast love and riches are already theirs. In a way, the older brother is the true runaway in this story, for he has never truly come home to trust his father.15.

Some group members may relate to both.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.17. We provided a Circles of Life diagram for you and the group to use to help you identify people who need to be connected in Christian community. When people are asked why they never go to church, they often say, “No one ever invited me.” Remind the group that our responsibility is to invite people, but we are not responsible for how they respond. Talk to the group about the importance of inviting people; remind them that healthy small groups make a habit of inviting friends, neighbors, unconnected church members, co-workers, etc., to join their groups or join them at a weekend service. When people get connected to a group of new friends, they often join the church.The Circles of Life represent one of the values of the Small Group Agree- ment “Welcome for Newcomers.” Some groups fear that newcomers will interrupt the intimacy that members have built over time. However, groups generally gain strength with the infusion of new blood. It’s like a river of living water  owing into a stagnant pond. Some groups remain permanently open, while others open periodically, such as at the beginning and ending of a study. Love grows by giving itself away. If your circle becomes too large for easy face-to-face conversations, you can simply form a second discussion circle in another room in your home.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18.

Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.

Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.Session Two The Pharisee and the Tax CollectorGrowing3. The people who were con dent of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else were the Pharisees and other religious leaders who saw themselves as the only ones righteous enough to be acceptable to God. Refer to the Study Notes in this session for more insight into the Pharisees. Such self-righteousness is damning (Rom. 10:3, Phil. 3:9) because we all fall short of God’s standard (Matt. 5:48) and are in need of salvation. See Luke 15:16 and Romans 14:10 for additional insight into this verse.4. The Pharisees were the most pious laypeople of the day, while the tax col- lectors were sharks. Yet both could approach God freely. We don’t have to clean up before we approach God; we need to approach him for his forgive- ness and help in cleaning up our act.5. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: The Pharisee’s prayer is entirely about himself. See Matthew 6:5 and Luke 22:41 for additional insight into this verse.“God, I thank you that I . . .” The key word here is that. Thank you that I . . . reinforces Jesus’s assertion in verse 9 that the Pharisees believed their righteousness was complete.“I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.” The Pharisee told God what a good man he was. He thanked God that he was not a sinner like everyone else. In this he erred in thinking that he was “not a sinner.” He lacked humility before God. Thanking God for who he was reveals that the Pharisee gave God the credit for who he was, but he considered himself better than other people, using other people as his standard for measuring righteousness. God, however, uses himself as the standard for righteousness, and he views arrogance and lack of compassion as sins on the level of adultery and theft. See Romans 3:23.91]]></text>
